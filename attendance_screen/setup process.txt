STEP 3: VERIFY BRIDGE ALIVE (CRITICAL)

Open browser:

http://localhost:3001/api/serial/ports


If this does NOT respond → bridge is dead → stop here.

🔧 STEP 4: CONNECT SERIAL (SAFE WAY)

Run:

curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/serial/connect ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"port\":\"COM4\",\"baudRate\":9600}"

EXPECTED OUTPUT IN BRIDGE CONSOLE
Connection request received
Connected to COM4 at 9600 baud


❌ If bridge crashes here → ESP32 / baud / serial issue

🔧 STEP 5: START FLUTTER WEB (LAST)
flutter run -d chrome


Open ONE tab only.

You MUST see:

Bridge connected! Socket ID: xxxx
